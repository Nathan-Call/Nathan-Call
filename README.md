Passionate IT/Software Professional with hands-on experience in areas including Full Stack Web Application Development, IT Services, System Administration, Cloud, Automation, and Cybersecurity.

Driven by a passion for building new systems and improving existing ones, I enjoy finding practical, scalable solutions to real-world problems. I've had the opportunity to work across multiple technical roles during and after college, where I supported everything from web app development to managing core operations for a software-based startup. I'm committed to continuous learning and enjoy bridging the gap between technical complexity and clear communication with non-technical audiences.
