I am a software developer versed in Python data collection, Python automation, Linux server administration, Linux cybersecurity, web application development, Firebase services, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.

I have had the blessed opportunity to work on multiple professional web/software development projects while still studying computer science at North Central University. Ever since I learned basic Java programming in my freshman year of college I was captivated with a passion for software development, problem-solving, and IT systems.
